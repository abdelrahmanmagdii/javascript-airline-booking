# javascript-airline-booking

Simple flight booking website. This was created as an initial project for a Web Development Course. The project was implemented using HTML5

A flight booking website with two main functionalities. Users can enter their name and book a seat on a plane, which has three possible sections, each with its own price.
After booking, users are displayed with their booking information, including their name, seat number, price and section. 
There are a limited number of seats on each plane and therefore if all seats are booked on a plane the user is prompted with a message indicating that. After a flight is fully booked, users can select the option to move onto the next available flight
